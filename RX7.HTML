            <h2><span class="RX7highlight">4. Mazda RX7</span></h2>
            <p><span class="RX7highlight">Built and owned by Keith Imoto, Dom's RX7 was modified a bit from Keith's original design. The car was originally gray and had a roll cage. The cage was removed because Vin could hardly fit in the car. We built several clones of this car and the clones were changed for their new role in 2 Fast 2 Furious.</span></p>
            <p><span class="RX7highlight">In the Hotwheels Variation, the car has rubber tires, Red and flashy white designs and sponsors, decorative details in which replicates the real car.</span></p>
