            <h2>5. Honda S2000</h2>
            <p>The S2000 was rented from R.J. de Vera who plays Danny Yamato in The Fast and the Furious. Despite being said that the car had "more than a hundred grand under the hood" in reality the car had no performance modifications applied to it other than a Compton supercharger kit (worth $8000 at the time).</p>
            <p>In the Hotwheels Variation, the car has rubber tires, black body with flake symbols on the hood, decorative details in which replicates the real car.</p>
